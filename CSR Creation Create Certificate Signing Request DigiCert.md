# CSR Creation | Create Certificate Signing Request | DigiCert
## General CSR Creation Guidelines

Before you can order an SSL certificate, it is recommended that you generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) from your server or device. [Learn more about SSL certificates »](https://www.digicert.com/tls-ssl/basic-tls-ssl-certificates)

A CSR is an encoded file that provides you with a standardized way to send DigiCert your public key as well as some information that identifies your company and domain name. When you generate a CSR, most server software asks for the following information: common name (e.g., www.example.com), organization name and location (country, state/province, city/town), key type (typically RSA), and key size (2048-bit minimum).

If you aren't sure of the exact company name or location when you generate the CSR, don't worry; we can change and finalize that information during our review process before we issue the certificate.

Once your CSR is created, you'll need to copy and paste it into the online order form when you go to purchase your SSL certificate. [Online Certificate Order Form »](https://www.digicert.com/order/order-1.php)

## Common Platforms & Operating Systems

## 2048-Bit Key Length Required

To remain secure, SSL certificates must use keys that are 2048-bits in length or greater. [More details »](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:MD5and1024)  
Can't generate a CSR with a 2048-bit key on your server platform? Please [contact us](https://www.digicert.com/contact-us).

## Wondering What Information is Needed for Your CSR?

1.  **Common Name** (fully qualified domain name \[FQDN] your certificate will secure)
2.  **Country** ([two-digit code](https://www.digicert.com/kb/ssl-certificate-country-codes.htm))
3.  **State or Locality** (full names e.g., California or Barcelona)
4.  **Organization Name** (full legal company or personal name as registered in your locality)
5.  **Organization Unit** (department in your organization the certificate is for \[e.g., IT or Marketing])

## Generating a CSR for a Wildcard Certificate?

When generating a CSR for a Wildcard certificate, the common name must start with an asterisk (_) (e.g., _.example.com). The Wildcard character (\*) can assume any name that doesn't have a dot character in it.
