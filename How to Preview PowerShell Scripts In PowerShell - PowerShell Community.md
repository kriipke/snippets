**Q:** When I use Windows Explorer and select a PowerShell script file ‚Äì I do not see the script in the preview window. Can I fix that?

**A:** You can make a few simple registry updates and do just what you want!

At some time in the deep and distant past, Windows Explorer gained the preview pane feature. The idea is simple: you select a file in Explorer and Windows shows you a preview of the file in a separate pane. I love this feature, although when clicking on a Word document, it could take a few moments before I could view. And if you are viewing a file, it was ‚Äúopen‚Äù and you could not delete it in a separate window! A great feature albeit with some minor side effects ‚Äì so it makes sense that this is turned off by default. But you can easily turn it back on!

## Microsoft PowerToys to the rescue??[](#microsoft-powertoys-to-the-rescue)

You can use [Microsoft‚Äôs Power Toys for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/powertoys) to enable Explorer to preview more file types. I love these tools ‚Äì and have them installed on my computers. Sadly, PowerToys currently does not enable previewing of PowerShell files.

## Enabling Preview in Windows Explorer[](#enabling-preview-in-windows-explorer)

As I mentioned above, file preview within Windows Explorer is disabled by default. To turn this on, use Explorer‚Äôs View menu and select preview. I leave the details of how to set this up as an exercise for the user. As a small aside, this setting gets reset each time you upgrade Windows ‚Äì as a Windows Insider, I have to reset this with each new build I take. üôÅ

Once you enable preview mode in Explorer as shown above, when you select a `.PS1` file ‚Äì you see something like this:

There is currently no mechanism in Explorer to change the list of file types to be displayed. Fortunately, there is a straightforward mechanism that involves setting a registry key value. To enable Explorer to display the relevant files, you can use the following script fragment:

    # Set path variables for PowerShell file types $Path1 =  'Registry::HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.ps1' $Path2 =  'Registry::HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.psm1' $Path3 =  'Registry::HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.psd1'  # Enable preview of those file types  New-ItemProperty  -Path $Path1 -Name  PerceivedType  -PropertyType  String  -Value  'text'  New-ItemProperty  -Path $Path2 -Name  PerceivedType  -PropertyType  String  -Value  'text'  New-ItemProperty  -Path $Path3 -Name  PerceivedType  -PropertyType  String  -Value  'text'

## Result![](#result)

Once you run this script, Explorer displays the script file, Explorer now looks like this:

That‚Äôs it ‚Äì a small change to the registry and I can now preview PowerShell files. Very handy!
